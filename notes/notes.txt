note that the format of zoho dates appears to be yyyy-mm-dd
i should be able to simply get that from the list of parameter and pass to new Date(ptoDate)


another thing to note is that i will need the following in the request from zohoCRM: zoho opportunity ID, PTO date, monitoring id, possibly inverter manufacturer (verify which monitoring platform), ALL PTO fields (to verify correct year and update any missing), estimated production


another note is that regarding cases in which for some reason PTO and production do not allign, this will not currently be apparent from the script. Should I really work on making this functionality, if so leadership needs to give me examples of how they want to respond to these situations (automated email, check again later--this would be the more complicated option? etc).

zoho code:
requestObj = crmAPIRequest.toMap();
requestBody = requestObj.get("body");
zohoId = requestBody.get("zohoId").toNumber();
value = requestBody.get("value").toNumber();
year = requestBody.get("year");
updateFieldString = "Year_" + year + "_Production";
updateInfo = {updateFieldString:value};
response = zoho.crm.updateRecord("Leads",zohoId,updateInfo);
return {"obj ":response};
